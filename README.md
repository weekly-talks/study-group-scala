_No option formed in study group. Try searching on the internet._

# What are the options to learn Scala?

Scala was create at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), which suggests that five courses at Coursera from this university is a good option.

- overview of courses https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2016/05/23/scala-moocs-specialization-launched.html
- EPFL's and other Scala courses on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=scala

Other options include:

- official tutorials at http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/
- _Learn_ section at the Lightbend site, which lists videos, e-books and other industry materials https://www.lightbend.com/learn (Lightbend is a commercial company behind Scala)
- other articles and tutorials on the internet, but we haven't reviewed them yet

We have both people who start from EPFL's courses and from official tutorials. Ask for their feedback on how it goes ;)

## Scala Programming for Data Science

Lightbend created a free learning path consisting of three courses on application of Scala programming for Data Science at https://bigdatauniversity.com/learn/scala/.
